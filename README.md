# TARE AEGIS-ID — POC Demo
### Trusted Access Response Engine · Energy & Utilities Security Platform

Post-grant identity security for AI agents on OT/ICS infrastructure.
Detects and responds to behavioural anomalies in real time — even when agent credentials are completely valid.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Activate virtual environment
```bash
c:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Aegis\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies (first time only)
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Train ML model (first time only)
```bash
cd ml
python generate_grid_data.py
python train_model.py
```

### 4. Set Groq API key
Create `backend/.env`:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here
```
Get a free key at console.groq.com

### 5. Start server
```bash
cd backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Open **http://localhost:8000**

## Six Attack Scenarios

| Button | Type | Detection Layer | TARE Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🤖 Fix Fault | Legitimate | Silent | None — all ALLOW |
| 🤖 Rogue | Attack — burst, all zones | Rules | FREEZE → DOWNGRADE |
| 🕵 Clone | Attack — forged identity | Auth layer | Blocked at door + ServiceNow ticket |
| ⚡ Escalate | Attack — pivot mid-session | Rules + ML | FREEZE → DOWNGRADE |
| 🔍 Slow&Low | Attack — quiet recon | ML only | FREEZE → DOWNGRADE |
| 🎯 Coord | Attack — two agents simultaneous | Rules | FREEZE → DOWNGRADE |

---

## Detection Layers

| Layer | Signals | Catches |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-grant auth | IDENTITY_MISMATCH | Forged tokens, cloned identities |
| Rule-based | BURST_RATE, OUT_OF_ZONE, HEALTHY_ZONE_ACCESS, SKIPPED_SIMULATION | Fast, aggressive attacks |
| ML ensemble | ML_ANOMALY (IsolationForest + RandomForest) | Slow & low recon, subtle patterns |

**TARE fires when 2 or more signals detected simultaneously.**
